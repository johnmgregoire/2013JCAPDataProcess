The binary encoding in the XML files is little-endian (specified explicitly in the arguments to struct.pack).

Hard-coded directories that should be changed once the infrastructure for this program is in place:

fomautomator.py -	sys.path.append() is called on whichever directory holds the 					mysql_dbcommlib module

			FUNC_DIR: the location where all of the version folders of the 					functions are stored (this should be somewhere on the server and
			should not be changeable in order for the data to be consistent
			across the same version)

rawdataparser.py -	RAW_DATA_PATH: the default location where the raw data .pck files 				are stored (this can be changed through the GUI or command line)
			
xmltranslator.py -	DTD_DIR: the directory that holds 'fomdata.dtd'
