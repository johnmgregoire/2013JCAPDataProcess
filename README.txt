All code written by John Gregoire, Allison Schubauer, and Daisy Hernandez. Code is a work in progress for processing JCAP-HTE data.

This program was written on Windows machines with Python 2.7 installed.  Some os and multiprocessing features may behave slightly differently on Linux or Mac.

External libraries required by this program:
PyQt 4.10.2 (uses Qt version 4.8.4 as the backend)
Numpy 1.6.1
Lxml 3.2.1

This program also requires the mysql_dbcommlib module from John Gregoire's JCAPPyDbComm repository, which uses MySQLdb 1.2.4.
